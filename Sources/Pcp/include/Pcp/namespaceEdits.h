/// the result includes the changes caused at \p curPath in this
/// cache itself.
///
/// To keep everything consistent, a namespace edit requires that
/// everything using the namespace edited site to be changed in an
/// appropriate way.  For example, if a referenced prim /A is renamed
/// to /B then everything referencing /A must be changed to reference
/// /B instead.  There are many other possibilities.
///
/// One possibility is that there are no opinions at \p curPath in
/// this cache's layer stack and the site exists due to some ancestor
/// arc.  This requires a relocation and only sites using \p curPath
/// that include the layer with the relocation must be changed in
/// response.  To find those sites, \p relocatesLayer indicates which
/// layer the client will write the relocation to.
///
/// Clients must perform the changes to correctly perform a namespace
/// edit.  All changes must be performed in a change block, otherwise
/// notices could be sent prematurely.
///
/// This method only works when the affected prim indexes have been
/// computed.  In general, this means you must have computed the prim
/// index of everything in any existing cache, otherwise you might miss
/// changes to objects in those caches that use the namespace edited
/// object.  Using the above example, if a prim with an uncomputed prim
/// index referenced /A then this method would not report that prim.
/// As a result that prim would continue to reference /A, which no
/// longer exists.
