// We cannot use a defaulted constructor for HdCommandDescriptor because
// of the const member variables. On some compilers and STL implementations
// the commandArgs member (which is a std::vector) does not have a
// user-provided c'tor, which C++ requires in order to generate a default
// c'tor for HdCommandDescriptor. So, we have to create an explicitly
// empty c'tor to avoid this problem.
//
// HdCommandArgDescriptor could use a defaulted constructor but since it
// also uses const member variables, using an explicit empty c'tor guards
// against the above issue should any members be added or changed.
