# ``PxOsd`` USD-OpenSubdiv Integration

## Overview

The ``PxOsd`` library integrates Pixar's Opensubdiv library that implements high performance subdivision surface

Within this library, utilities are provided to handle tasks such as evaluation 
and validation of subdivided mesh topology using Opensubdiv topology refiners.
