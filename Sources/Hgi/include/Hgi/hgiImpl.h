/// \class Hgi
///
/// Hydra Graphics Interface.
/// Hgi is used to communicate with one or more physical gpu devices.
///
/// Hgi provides API to create/destroy resources that a gpu device owns.
/// The lifetime of resources is not managed by Hgi, so it is up to the caller
/// to destroy resources and ensure those resources are no longer used.
///
/// Commands are recorded in 'HgiCmds' objects and submitted via Hgi.
///
/// Thread-safety:
///
/// Modern graphics APIs like Metal and Vulkan are designed with multi-threading
/// in mind. We want to try and take advantage of this where possible.
/// However we also wish to continue to support OpenGL for the time being.
///
/// In an application where OpenGL is involved, when we say "main thread" we
/// mean the thread on which the gl-context is bound.
///
/// Each Hgi backend should at minimum support the following:
///
/// * Single threaded Hgi::SubmitCmds on main thread.
/// * Single threaded Hgi::Resource Create*** / Destroy*** on main thread.
/// * Multi threaded recording of commands in Hgi***Cmds objects.
/// * A Hgi***Cmds object should be creatable on the main thread, recorded
///   into with one secondary thread (only one thread may use a Cmds object) and
///   submitted via the main thread.
///
/// Each Hgi backend is additionally encouraged to support:
///
/// * Multi threaded support for resource creation and destruction.
///
/// We currently do not rely on these additional multi-threading features in
/// Hydra / Storm where we still wish to run OpenGL. In Hydra we make sure to
/// use the main-thread for resource creation and command submission.
/// One day we may wish to switch this to be multi-threaded so new Hgi backends
/// are encouraged to support it.
///
/// Pseudo code what should minimally be supported:
///
///     vector<HgiGraphicsCmds> cmds
///
///     for num_threads
///         cmds.push_back( Hgi->CreateGraphicsCmds() )
///
///     parallel_for i to num_threads
///         cmds[i]->SetViewport()
///         cmds[i]->Draw()
///
///     for i to num_threads
///         hgi->SubmitCmds( cmds[i] )
///
