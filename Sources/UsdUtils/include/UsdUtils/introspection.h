///  * approxMemoryInMb - approximate memory allocated when opening the stage
///  with all the models loaded.
///  * totalPrimCount - total number of prims
///  * modelCount - number of models
///  * instancedModelCount - number of instanced models
///  * assetCount - number of assets
///  * prototypeCount - number of prototypes
///  * totalInstanceCount - total number of instances (including nested instances)
///  * two sub-dictionaries, 'primary' and 'prototypes' for the "primary" prim tree
///  and for all the prototype subtrees respectively, containing the following
///  stats:
///  * primCounts - a sub-dictionary containing the following
///     * totalPrimCount - number of prims
///     * activePrimCount - number of active prims
///     * inactivePrimCount - number of inactive prims
///     * pureOverCount - number of pure overs
///     * instanceCount - number of instances
///  * primCountsByType - a sub-dictionary containing prim counts keyed by the
///  prim type.
///
/// Returns the stage that was opened.
///
/// The "prototypes" subdictionary is populated only if the stage has one or more
/// instanced models.
///
/// \note The approximate memory allocated when opening the stage is computed
/// and reported *only* if the TfMallocTag system has already been initialized
/// by the client, and the number will represent only *additional* consumed
/// memory, so if some of the layers the stage uses are already open, the true
/// memory consumption for the stage may be higher than reported.
/// \sa TfMallocTag::IsInitialized()

/// \note Only component models are included in 'modelCount' and
/// 'instancedModelCount'.
