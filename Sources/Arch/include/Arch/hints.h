/// \c ARCH_GUARANTEE_TO_COMPILER(bool-expr) informs the compiler about value
/// constraints to help it make better optimizations.  It is of critical

/// compiler may generate invalid code.
///
/// This can be useful, for example, when an out-of-line function call could
/// potentially change a value previously known to compiler, but does not, based
/// on code invariants.
///
/// This hint is best used after investigating generated assembly code and
/// seeing useless/unreachable code being generated that can be prevented with
/// this hint.  This hint is often times not necessary, and should never be
/// inserted on a whim.  The compiler will run with the promises we make it to
/// the ends of the earth, and this can lead to surprising results
/// (e.g. undefined behavior) if we are not careful.
