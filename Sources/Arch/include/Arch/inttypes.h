/// \file arch/inttypes.h
/// \ingroup group_arch_Bits
/// Define integral types.
///
/// By including this file, the "standard" integer types \c int16_t,
/// \c int32_t, and \c int64_t are all defined, as are their unsigned
/// counterparts \c uint16_t, \c uint32_t, and \c uint64_t.  This also
/// includes the macros for limits, constants, and printf format specifiers.

// These defines should in theory not be needed to get the related sized-int
// macros, as this was not adopted by the C++ committee and was dropped by the C
// committee, but glibc erroneously "respects" them so we need to have them.
