/// \class SdfPathExpression
///
/// Objects of this class represent a logical expression syntax tree consisting
/// of SdfPathPattern s, (with optionally embedded predicate expressions), and
/// Expression References joined by the set-algebraic operators `+` (union), `&`
/// (intersection), `-` (difference), `~` (complement) and an implied-union
/// operator represented by two subexpressions joined by whitespace.
///
/// An SdfPathExpression can be constructed from a string, which will parse the
/// string into an expression object.  The syntax for an expression is as
/// follows:
///
/// The fundamental building blocks are path patterns and expression references.
/// A path pattern is similar to an SdfPath, but it may contain glob-style
/// wild-card characters, embedded brace-enclosed predicate expressions (see
/// SdfPredicateExpression) and `//` elements indicating arbitrary levels of
/// prim hierarchy.  For example, consider
/// <code>/foo//bar*/baz{active:false}</code>.  This pattern matches absolute
/// paths whose first component is `foo`, that also have some descendant prim
/// whose name begins with `bar`, which in turn has a child named `baz` where
/// the predicate `active:false` evaluates to true.
///
/// An expression reference starts with `%` followed by a prim path, a `:`, and
/// a name.  There is also one "special" expression reference, `%_` which means
/// "the weaker" expression when composing expressions together.  See
/// ComposeOver() and ResolveReferences() for more information.
///
/// These building blocks may be joined as mentioned above, with `+`, `-`, `&`,
/// or whitespace, and may be complemented with `~`, and grouped with `(` and
/// `)`.
