/// Manage a single instance of an object.
///
/// Many classes (for example, registries) should have only a single, globally
/// available instance that is created as needed on demand.  This is a classic
/// design pattern known as a \e singleton.  Additionally, creation of this
/// class (though not access to it per se) must be made threadsafe.
///
/// There are two possibilities in creating a singleton: you can create a
/// class all of whose member functions and variables are static, and let
/// users access this class.  Unfortunately, instantiating the static
/// variables of this class is prone to difficulty; more importantly, should
/// you change your mind and wish to allow multiple instances of the class,
/// much rewriting follows.
///
/// A better solution is to define the class with regular members and
/// variables, and then permit only a single instance of the class to exist.
/// This is the philosophy embodied by the \c TfSingleton template.  It takes
/// care of both multithreaded initialization and initialization before main;
/// the cost of this is quite low (a single boolean comparison to access the
/// instanced object after initial creation). The \c TfSingleton template
/// works in conjunction with a macro in the source file
/// TF_INSTANTIATE_SINGLETON(), which is itself defined by  including the file
/// "Tf/instantiateSingleton.h".
///
/// \anchor TfSingleton_typicalUse
/// <B> Typical Use </B>
///
/// The typical use of \c TfSingleton is as follows:
/// \code
///     // file: registry.h
///     #include "Tf/singleton.h"
///
///     class Registry {
///         Registry(const Registry&) = delete;
///         Registry& operator=(const Registry&) = delete;
///     public:
///         static Registry& GetInstance() {
///              return TfSingleton<Registry>::GetInstance();
///         }
///
///         ...
///
///     private:
///         Registry();
///         ~Registry();
///
///         friend class TfSingleton<Registry>;
///      };
///
///     // file: Registry.cpp
///     #include "common/astrology/registry.h"
///     #include "Tf/instantiateSingleton.h"
///
///     TF_INSTANTIATE_SINGLETON(Registry);
///
///
///     // file: RandomCode.cpp
///     #include "common/astrology/registry.h"
///
///     void Code() {
///          Registry& r = Registry::GetInstance();
///          r.Lookup(...);
///          ...
///     }
/// \endcode
///
/// The constructor and destructor are declared private, and the singleton
/// object will typically delete its copy constructor and assignment operator
/// to prevent copying. Note that singleton objects quite commonly also make
/// use of \c TfRegistryManager to acquire the data they need throughout a
/// program.
///
/// The friend class \c TfSingleton<Registry> is the only class allowed to
/// create an instance of a Registry.  The helper function \c
/// Registry::GetInstance() is for convenience only; one can just as well call
/// the longer \c TfSingleton<Registry>::GetInstance() to obtain a reference
/// to the sole instance of the registry.
