/// Gets the UsdGeomCamera matching \p cameraPath from the USD stage \p stage.
///
/// If \p cameraPath is an absolute path, this is equivalent to
/// UsdGeomCamera::Get(). Otherwise, if \p cameraPath is a single-element path
/// representing just the name of a camera prim, then \p stage will be searched
/// looking for a UsdGeomCamera matching that name. The UsdGeomCamera schema
/// for that prim will be returned if found, or an invalid UsdGeomCamera will
/// be returned if not.
///
/// Note that if \p cameraPath is a multi-element path, a warning is issued and
/// it is just made absolute using the absolute root path before searching. In
/// the future, this could potentially be changed to use a suffix-based match.
