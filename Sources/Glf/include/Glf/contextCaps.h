/// \class GlfContextCaps
///
/// This class is intended to be a cache of the capabilites
/// (resource limits and features) of the underlying
/// GL context.
///
/// It serves two purposes.  Firstly to reduce driver
/// transition overhead of querying these values.
/// Secondly to provide access to these values from other
/// threads that don't have the context bound.
///
/// In the event of failure (InitInstance() wasn't called
/// or an issue accessing the GL context), a reasonable
/// set of defaults, based on GL minimums, is provided.
///
///
/// TO DO (bug #124971):
///   - LoadCaps() should be called whenever the context
///     changes.
///   - Provide a mechanism where other Hd systems can
///     subscribe to when the caps changes, so they can
///     update and invalidate.
///

  /// InitInstance queries the GL context for its capabilities.
  /// It should be called by the application before using systems
  /// that depend on the caps, such as Hydra.  A good example would be
  /// to pair the call to initialize after a call to initialize GL
