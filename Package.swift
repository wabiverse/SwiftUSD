    /*
      the swiftpm docs are vague on this, however, this setting only
      currently applies to targeting minimum apple platform versions
      and the omission of linux and windows here (they do not exist
      on the SupportedPlatform struct) does not mean linux & windows
      are not supported. For now, one can disregard this setting on all
      platforms that are not apple.

      Note: the apple platform minimums are quite recent, this is due to
      CXX interop only appearing in recent versions of these apple SDKs,
      without setting these where they are - we would otherwise have to
      muck up the swift apis with @availibility macros, to avoid errors
      complaining about (ex. 'UsdStage is only available in macOS 14 or
      later').
